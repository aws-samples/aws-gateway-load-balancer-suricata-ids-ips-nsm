This folder contains `base` cloudformation templates.

These templates will setup the GitOps pipeline and will copy this GitHub Repo into AWS CodeCommit which will be the Git repo you work against.

* The [base-new-vpc.yaml](/cloudformation/base-new-vpc.yaml) template will setup a new environment from scratch, including a VPC where Suricata will be deployed. 

* The [base-existing-vpc.yaml](/cloudformation/base-existing-vpc.yaml) template (TODO) will deploy Suricata in an already existing VPC. You need to make sure your existing VPC supports the minimum requirements.

The `base` cloudformation templates will setup an environment which contains the GitOps pipeline.

When Suricata is later deployed using the GitOps Pipeline the full environment will look like the following:
